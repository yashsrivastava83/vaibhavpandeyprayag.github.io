      HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language, and it is the most widely used
      language to write Web Pages. Hypertext refers to the way in which Web
      pages (HTML documents) are linked togerther. Thus, the link available on a
      webpage is called Hypertext. As its name suggests, HTML is a Markup
      Language which means you use HTML to simply "mark-up" a text document with
      tags that tell a Web browser how to structure it to display. Originally,
      HTML was developed with the intent of defining the structure of documents
      like headings, paragraphs, lists, and so forth to facilitate the sharing
      of scientific information between researchers.
